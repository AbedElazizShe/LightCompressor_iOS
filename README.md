# LightCompressor

A powerful and easy-to-use video compression package for iOS.  It  generates a compressed MP4 video with a modified width, height, and bitrate (the number of bits per seconds that determines the video and audio filesâ€™ size and quality). It is based on [LightCompressor](https://github.com/AbedElazizShe/LightCompressor) for Android.
